### Best Practices
1. **One page for junior roles**, maximum 2 pages for senior positions
2. **Recency matters**: Most recent experience is most important
3. **Customization**: Create different versions for different industries
4. **Proofreading**: Double-check for typos and formatting before submitting
5. **Testing**: Download PDF and open in various browsers/devices
